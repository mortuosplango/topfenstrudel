# Topfenstrudel

This is a proof-of-concept Firefox extension that turns Mastodon posts with links to strudel patches on [strudel.tidalcycles.org](https://strudel.tidalcycles.org/) or the string `// #strudel` into [strudel repls](https://github.com/tidalcycles/strudel).

As the web extension API is a web standard, it should probably also work in Chrome.

## To install

Go to [latest release](https://github.com/mortuosplango/topfenstrudel/releases/latest) and download xpi file. Firefox should prompt you to install it. If not, try to double click it or drag and drop it onto Firefox.

## To run the code

Use [web-ext](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/) or manually load the extension via [about:debugging](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/browser-extension-development-tools/#testing-and-debugging-tools).
